"""The plugin SDK. This module is the public, stable surface for plugin authors.

A plugin is a directory containing ``plugin.py`` (or ``init.py``, still
accepted) that defines one subclass of :class:`Plugin`:

    from amca.api import Plugin, PluginContext

    class hello(Plugin):
        name = "hello"

        def should_load(self, ctx: PluginContext) -> bool:
            return ctx.working_dir.has_file("Makefile")

        def load(self, ctx: PluginContext) -> int:
            ctx.log.log(f"args: {ctx.args}")
            return 0

Two things changed from the previous plugin API, both for the same reason.

First, plugins now ``import amca.api`` instead of importing from a copy of
amca's internals vendored into every plugin directory. Those copies existed
because the old amca was a frozen binary with no importable package: each
preset shipped its own ``amca/logger.py``, ``amca/dirparse.py`` and
``amca/plugin_base.py``, which then drifted from the originals. amca is a real
package now, so a plugin can just import it.

Second, the five positional parameters became one :class:`PluginContext`.
Adding a sixth piece of context used to be a breaking change for every plugin
in existence; now it is a new attribute. Old-style five-argument plugins are
still detected and adapted — see ``amca.plugins.loader``.
