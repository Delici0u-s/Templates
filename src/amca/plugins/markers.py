"""Splitting ``amca`` argv into amca's own arguments and per-plugin payloads.

    amca run ---meson -s ---autoscript --fast

              ^^^^^^^^ marker      ^^^^^^^^^^^^ marker
    amca args: ["run"]
    meson:     ["-s"]
    autoscript:["--fast"]

The previous implementation had two functions that disagreed about what a
marker is. ``split_at_first_plugin_marker`` cut argv at the first token that
merely *started with* the prefix, while ``extract_plugin_args`` then matched
only exact ``prefix + known-plugin-name`` tokens. Anything in between —
a typo like ``---mesn``, a plugin that was installed but disabled, or the
prefix's own value appearing as an argument — split the argv and was then
silently dropped along with every argument after it. No warning, no error, the
build just quietly did the wrong thing.

Here there is one definition of a marker and one pass over argv, and an
unrecognised marker is a hard error that lists what was expected.
