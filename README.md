# amca

**One command that knows what to do in whatever directory you are standing in.**

`amca` is a dispatcher for plugins based on the current directory,
works out which of its plugins apply, and runs them. The behaviour lives in
plugins.

```console
# exaples
$ cd ~/code/renderer     # a C project
$ amca                   # with meson plugin installed and meson.build setup
[setup] … [compile] … [install] … [test] … [run]

$ cd ~/code/scraper      # a shell script
$ amca                   # autoscript plugin installed
[autoscript] sh /home/you/code/scraper/amca_auto_script.sh

```

Same keystroke everywhere. amca decides *which* plugin applies and hands it the
arguments; it has no opinion about what a build is.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 or newer. Nothing else — amca has **no required runtime
dependencies**, deliberately, so a broken third-party wheel can never stop it
from starting. Individual plugins may have their own.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 --with 'amca[all]' amca
```

`--python` pins a `uv`-managed interpreter so a distro Python upgrade cannot
break amca. Alternatives:

```bash
pipx install 'amca[all]'
pip install --user 'amca[all]'

# to track main instead of the last release:
uv tool install --python 3.13 --with 'amca[all]' git+https://github.com/Delici0u-s/amca
```

| extra | gives you | without it |
|---|---|---|
| `tui` | arrow-key selection menus (InquirerPy) | numbered stdin prompts |
| `remote` | installing plugins from GitHub (requests) | bundled plugins only |
| `all` | both | |

Upgrade with `uv tool upgrade amca` or `pipx reinstall amca`. There is no build
step and nothing to recompile after a system update.

**Uninstall:**

```bash
amca completions --uninstall     # first, while amca can still find its files
uv tool uninstall amca           # or: pipx uninstall amca
rm -rf ~/.config/amca ~/.local/state/amca
```

## Two commands

amca ships two console scripts, split by lifetime:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`amca`** | run plugins, and everything scoped to a project or a single run |
| **`amcapl`** | manage which plugins exist on this machine at all |

They share global flags and configuration. `amcapl` is separate so `amca --help`
stays short and so plugin management cannot be triggered by a stray argument
during a build.

## Command reference

```
amca [global flags] [command] [MARKER plugin-args …]

  (none) / run     run every enabled plugin that applies here
  new              create an amca root (.amca/) in this directory
  remove           delete the amca root
  root             show or manage root detection (show, ignore, unignore, clear-ignored)
  args PLUGIN      edit that plugin's per-project default arguments
  config           inspect or change settings
  plugins          list installed plugins and their markers
  completions      print, install or remove shell tab-completion
  doctor           check paths, config, plugins, tools; non-zero on a problem

amcapl [global flags] <command> [NAME …]

  list                 what is installed, and its marker
  install              fetch and enable
  enable | disable | toggle
  uninstall
  update               re-fetch (use after editing a local plugin source)
  call NAME -- ARGS    run one plugin directly, skipping should_load
```

Global flags: `--config-dir --plugin-dir --depth --editor --marker-prefix
--log-mode --log-level --log-prefix --on-error --on-missing --debug --version`,
plus `--dry-run` on `amca`. **Flags apply to one run and never write to your
config file** — see [Configuration](#configuration).

Omit the names on any `amcapl` command and you get a picker. **In the checkbox,
space selects and enter confirms** — enter on its own selects nothing.

Exit status: `0` success, `1` a plugin or command failed, `2` bad usage or bad
configuration, `130` interrupted.

---

## Plugins

A plugin decides whether it applies (`should_load`) and then does the work
(`load`). amca runs every enabled plugin that applies.

### Passing arguments to a plugin

Everything after a **marker** goes to that plugin, until the next marker:

```bash
amca ---example --show
amca ---autoscript deploy --dry
```

A marker is `plugins.marker_prefix` (default `---`) plus the plugin's folder
name, underscores written as dashes. `amca plugins --markers` prints the exact
strings this directory accepts.

**Naming a plugin runs only that plugin.** With no markers, `amca` runs
everything applicable — the usual case. Set `plugins.marker_scope=all` if you
want a marker to add arguments without narrowing the run.

**An unrecognised marker is an error**, and it suggests the fix:

```console
$ amca ---autoScr
amca: unknown plugin marker '---autoScr'
  did you mean: ---autoscript
  known markers: ---autoscript, ---meson
```

A bare `--` stops marker parsing, for values that begin with the prefix:

```bash
amca config set plugins.marker_prefix ä
```

Avoid shell glob or history characters (`* ? [ ] { } ~ !`) in the prefix — your
shell expands the marker before amca sees it. `config set` warns if you try.

### Per-project default arguments

`.amca/args/<plugin>.args`, one argument per line, `#` for comments. They are
placed before anything you type, so a project can pin a flag while a
command-line flag still overrides it.

```bash
amca args meson        # opens it in $EDITOR
amca args meson --show
```

### Where plugins live

Three different places, easy to conflate:

| | |
|---|---|
| `<config>/plugins/` | **installed** — what actually runs. `amcapl` manages it; `plugins.dir` moves it. |
| `plugins/amca_presets/` in this repo | the three bundled with amca, so `amcapl install` works offline |
| anywhere you like | **yours** |

Your own plugins do not belong in this repo. Add a source:

```bash
amca config set plugins.sources builtin,/home/you/my-amca-plugins
amcapl install cargo
amcapl update cargo            # re-copy after editing
```

While iterating, skip the copy entirely:

```bash
amca --plugin-dir ~/my-amca-plugins ---cargo build
```

## Writing a plugin

A plugin is a directory containing `plugin.py` with exactly one subclass of
`amca.api.Plugin`:

```python
from amca.api import Plugin, PluginContext, PluginError
from amca.core import proc


class cargo(Plugin):
    description = "cargo build/run"

    def should_load(self, ctx: PluginContext) -> bool:
        # Cheap — called for every enabled plugin on every invocation.
        return ctx.project_dir_info().has_file("Cargo.toml")

    def load(self, ctx: PluginContext) -> int:
        if ctx.dry_run:
            ctx.log.log("would run cargo build")
            return 0
        cargo = proc.resolve_tool("cargo", hint="install rustup")
        return proc.call([cargo, "build", *ctx.args], cwd=str(ctx.project_dir))
```

`PluginContext` carries `args`, `working_dir`, `root`, `plugin_dir` (your
private per-project directory, already created), `dirs`, `log` and `dry_run`.

Import `amca.api` directly — amca is an installed package. Do not vendor copies
of its internals. Raise `PluginError` for a clean message with no traceback.
Return an exit status; `0` or `None` means success.

Subdirectories work and are namespaced per plugin, so two plugins can both have
an `_impl/` without colliding:

```
my-plugin/
    plugin.py
    _impl/
        __init__.py
```

Start from the `example` plugin rather than from one of the real presets:

```bash
amcapl install example
amca ---example --show     # prints every PluginContext field and what it is for
```

## Bundled plugins

Three, installed on demand with `amcapl install NAME`. None of them is
privileged; they are ordinary plugins that happen to ship inside the wheel.

| | applies when | does |
|---|---|---|
| `example` | never — call it directly | sixty commented lines to copy: selection, `--dry-run`, `PluginError`, tool resolution, logging |
| `autoscript` | `amca_auto_script.*` is present | runs it, forwarding your arguments |
| `meson` | `meson.build` carries the amca variable block | `setup → reconfigure → compile → install → test → run` |

<details>
<summary><code>autoscript</code> — details</summary>

Runs `amca_auto_script[.sh|.bash|.zsh]` (`.ps1`/`.bat`/`.cmd` on Windows) from
the working directory, falling back to the project root.

```bash
amca ---autoscript --new       # create one (asks which shell)
amca ---autoscript build       # forwarded to the script
amca ---autoscript -- --help   # forward --help verbatim
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><code>meson</code> — details</summary>

Needs `meson`, which needs `ninja` and a compiler.

```bash
amca ---meson                 # whole pipeline
amca ---meson compile         # one step
amca ---meson -s              # clean first
amca ---meson -n t -n e       # skip test and run
amca ---meson -Ab "--buildtype=debug" -Ae "--verbose"
amca ---meson --print-template > meson.build
```

Applies only to a `meson.build` carrying the amca variable block, so it stays
inert in meson projects that are not yours:

```meson
amca_var__meson__version_behaviour = '2.0.1'
amca_var__meson__build_dir         = 'build'
amca_var__meson__executable_name   = 'myapp'
amca_var__meson__install_dir       = '../compiled'   # relative to build_dir
```

`reconfigure` re-runs meson only when the *set* of source files changes —
ninja handles content changes. `.vscode/launch.json` and `.clangd` are kept
pointing at the current build directory.
</details>

## Configuration

One JSON file. Four layers, lowest priority first:

```
built-in default  →  config file  →  AMCA_* env var  →  command-line flag
```

**Only `amca config set` writes to disk.** Command-line flags apply to that run
and nothing else.

| | config | state (logs, caches, first-run marker) |
|---|---|---|
| Linux/BSD | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/amca` → `~/.config/amca` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/amca` → `~/.local/state/amca` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/amca` | `~/Library/Caches/amca` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\amca` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\amca` |

Override with `--config-dir` / `$AMCA_CONFIG_DIR` and `$AMCA_STATE_DIR`.
`amca config path` prints the one actually in use.

```bash
amca config list --origin      # every setting, its value, and which layer won
amca config list --changed
amca config get plugins.marker_prefix
amca config set plugins.marker_prefix '+++'
amca config unset core.editor
amca config describe log.mode  # type, default, env var name
amca config edit
```

`--origin` answers "I changed it and nothing happened": it shows whether an env
var is overriding your edit, whether the key is real (unknown keys are reported,
not ignored), and which file is actually in use.

Hand-editing the JSON is fully supported — `config set` is a convenience.
Nested and dotted keys both work. Every setting has an env var:
`plugins.marker_prefix` → `AMCA_PLUGINS_MARKER_PREFIX`.

<details>
<summary>All settings</summary>

| key | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `core.debug` | `false` | extra diagnostics and full tracebacks |
| `core.greet` | `false` | print a greeting on every invocation |
| `core.editor` | `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`/`nano` | editor for `amca args` |
| `root.folder_name` | `.amca` | marker directory identifying a project root |
| `root.search_depth` | `5` | how far up to look for it |
| `root.ask_to_create` | `true` | offer to create one (TTY only) |
| `root.ignored_paths` | `[]` | where not to ask; `amca root ignore` |
| `log.mode` | `console` | `console`, `file`, `both`, `silent` |
| `log.level` | `INFO` | `INFO`, `SUCCESS`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL` |
| `log.prefix` | `none` | `none`, `minimal`, `simple`, `normal`, `verbose` |
| `plugins.dir` | `<config>/plugins` | where installed plugins live |
| `plugins.enabled` | `[]` | which may run; `amcapl enable` |
| `plugins.marker_prefix` | `---` | |
| `plugins.marker_scope` | `selected` | `selected` or `all` |
| `plugins.on_error` | `continue` | or `abort` |
| `plugins.on_missing` | `warn` | `ignore`, `warn`, `abort` |
| `plugins.announce_loaded` | `false` | log each plugin as it runs |
| `plugins.sources` | `builtin, github:…` | where `amcapl install` looks |

</details>

### External tools

```bash
export AMCA_TOOL_MESON=/opt/meson/bin/meson
export AMCA_TOOL_NINJA=samu
```

## Security

**A plugin is arbitrary Python that runs as you, with no sandbox.** amca
imports `plugin.py` and calls it; it does not inspect, restrict or review what
that code does. Treat installing a plugin exactly like `curl … | sh`.

Concretely:

- `amcapl install` copies a directory from a **source** and enables it. The
  defaults are `builtin` (inside the wheel you already trust) and a GitHub
  repository. Anything you add to `plugins.sources` — a URL, a local path —
  becomes code that runs on your next `amca`.
- `should_load` runs for **every enabled plugin on every invocation**, before
  you have named anything. An enabled-and-installed plugin therefore executes
  in every directory you type `amca` in, not only where it applies.
- `.amca/args/<plugin>.args` is read from the project directory, so cloning an
  untrusted repository that contains a `.amca/` directory hands that repo
  influence over the flags your plugins receive. Run
  `amca args <plugin> --show` before running amca in a repo you did not write.
- Shell completion shells out to `amca` on every keypress. That is amca itself,
  by absolute path — nothing from the project directory.

`amca doctor` lists every installed plugin and where it came from.

## Shell completion

**Usually nothing to do.** The first time you run amca interactively it writes
a completion script to your shell's per-user completion directory and says so
once. bash and fish pick it up on the next shell.

zsh only reads directories on `$fpath`, so it needs one extra line:

```bash
amca completions --install --rc     # adds a delimited block to ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
```

```bash
amca completions --status           # per shell: installed? active? which helper?
amca completions --uninstall        # removes the file(s) and the rc block
amca completions bash > somewhere   # just print it
export AMCA_NO_AUTO_COMPLETION=1    # opt out entirely
```

A wheel cannot run code at install time (PEP 427), so `pip`, `pipx` and `uv
tool` have no way to register completions — only a distro package can. Doing it
on first run is the closest equivalent that works for every install method.
Nothing is added to a shell rc file unless you pass `--rc`.

bash and fish autoload by command name, so `amcapl` gets its own file alongside
`amca`'s; zsh binds both from a single `#compdef` line.

**Using an alias?** The generated script calls amca by absolute path, so a venv
install off `PATH` still completes — but the alias needs registering:

```bash
amca completions --install --command a3
# zsh also needs, in your rc:  compdef _amca a3
```

Completion is dynamic: plugin names, markers and config keys come from amca at
completion time, so installing a plugin or changing the prefix takes effect
immediately. That costs one `amca` invocation per keypress. The helpers are
scriptable on their own:

```bash
amca plugins --names
amca plugins --markers
amca config list --keys
```

---

## When something is wrong

```bash
amca doctor
```

Checks paths, which config layer each non-default setting came from, root
resolution, every plugin's health, external tools, and the subprocess
environment. Exits non-zero when it finds a problem. It is the right thing to
paste into an issue.

<details>
<summary>Upgrading from amca 2.x</summary>

```bash
amca config migrate --dry-run     # show what would be imported
amca config migrate
```

Keys were renamed and several boolean pairs became enums:

| 2.x | 3.x |
|---|---|
| `args.plugin_prefix` | `plugins.marker_prefix` |
| `generic.plugin_path` | `plugins.dir` |
| `generic.exit_on_plugin_error` | `plugins.on_error` = `continue`\|`abort` |
| `generic.exit_on_plugin_not_found` | `plugins.on_missing` = `ignore`\|`warn`\|`abort` |
| `logging.print_loaded` | `plugins.announce_loaded` |
| `extreamly_important.greet_user` | `core.greet` |

Then remove the old install **before** deleting the old checkout — the
uninstaller is the only thing that knows to strip the `# >>> amca PATH >>>`
block from your shell rc:

```bash
python install_uninstall_update.py uninstall --keep-config
```

Existing plugins keep working: the loader detects the old five-argument
`should_load(amca_root_dir, amca_root_plugin_dir, working_dir, dir_parser, args)`
and adapts it. Port them when convenient.

If you upgrade by extracting a release over an old checkout, note that
unzipping does not delete removed files — `amca doctor` will tell you if a
stale `src/amca/presets/` is left behind.

**Why 3.0 exists.** 2.x shipped as a PyInstaller `--onefile` binary rebuilt at
install time. That put a private copy of CPython on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for every
child process, so after a distro Python upgrade the system `meson` loaded
amca's stale `libpython` and died with `internal Python C API version
mismatch`. 3.0 is a normal Python package, which makes that class of bug
structurally impossible. Along the way: CLI flags no longer write to your
config file; plugin markers have one definition instead of two disagreeing
ones; root discovery no longer runs at import time; plugins import `amca.api`
instead of vendoring internals; and two plugins can have identically named
submodules without shadowing.
</details>

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Delici0u-s/amca && cd amca
pip install -e '.[all,dev]'

pytest -q                    # unit tests, under a second
python tests/e2e.py          # end-to-end matrix, real subprocesses
python tests/e2e.py --list   # the matrix without running it
python tests/e2e.py -k markers -v
ruff check src tests plugins
mypy
```

Layout:

```
src/amca/              the application
plugins/amca_presets/  bundled plugins — content, not application code
tests/
```

`tests/test_regressions.py` is one test per defect that shipped in 2.x. Add to
it rather than deleting from it. `tests/e2e.py` runs the real console scripts
against throwaway config and project directories; cases marked `!` exercise a
mistake, hostile argv, or a broken component, and there are more of those than
happy paths. `tests/fixtures/probe/` is a plugin that dumps its whole
`PluginContext` as JSON and can be driven into any failure mode with `PROBE_*`
environment variables. `tests/test_completion_scripts.py` sources the generated
shell scripts and drives the completion functions for real — emitting a script
is not evidence that it completes anything.

## Platform support

| | |
|---|---|
| Linux | fully tested |
| macOS | code paths tested by simulation, not executed |
| Windows | code paths tested by simulation, not executed |

`tests/test_platform.py` patches `os.name` / `sys.platform` and reloads the
affected modules to exercise the non-Linux branches: config directories, the
`.exe` suffix, the autoscript interpreter table, non-POSIX `shlex` splitting,
colour detection, read-only file deletion. That verifies the branches are
correct and reachable — not that Windows behaves as expected.

Windows caveats: plugin folder names are matched case-sensitively, so keep them
lowercase; ANSI colour needs Windows Terminal or a console accepting
`ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING`; `autoscript` does not offer an
extensionless script, since such a file is not executable there.
